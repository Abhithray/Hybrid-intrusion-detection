 Hybrid Intrusion Detection System

A machine learning-based hybrid intrusion detection system (HIDS) designed to detect and classify cyber threats with higher accuracy. This project integrates supervised and unsupervised learning methods to improve anomaly detection in network traffic.

 Features
- Combination of ML algorithms for hybrid detection
- Preprocessing of datasets (feature selection, normalization, encoding)
- Training and evaluation with benchmark intrusion datasets
- Comparative performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

 Usage
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhithray/Hybrid-intrusion-detection.git
